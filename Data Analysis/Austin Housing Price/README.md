The goal of this code is to analyze the relationship between the housing price index (HPI) and the unemployment rate in the Austin Round Rock area. Using publicly available data from two CSV files, the code imports and processes the data to produce two visualizations. First, it computes the rolling average of the HPI and unemployment rate, allowing trends over time to be easily observed. Second, it creates a bar graph of the HPI by year, highlighting any changes in the HPI over time. By comparing these visualizations, the code demonstrates a negative correlation between the HPI and the unemployment rate.
