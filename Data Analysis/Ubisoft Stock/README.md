This program uses a Simple-Moving-Average with a 20-day period, and Standard Deviation to produce the Bollinger Bands for the closing stock price of the game company “Ubisoft”. The SMA is used to smooth out the graph of the closing price by averaging out the fluctuations. The Bollinger Bands are produced by taking the SMA, adding or subtracting it from the Standard Deviation, and then multiplying it by two. Bollinger Bands are used in finance to help decide whether to buy or sell a stock based on the price’s proximity to the upper and lower band.
