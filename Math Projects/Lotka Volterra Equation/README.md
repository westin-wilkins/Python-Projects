The Lotka-Volterra equations comprises two differential equations that capture the dynamics of predator and prey populations in a biological system. Specifically, 
the equations demonstrate that as the predator population grows, the prey population declines, and conversely, as the prey population diminishes, so does the predator population.
To visualize this relationship, the code employs scipy.integrate to solve the Lotka-Volterra equations, and the resulting solution is plotted.
