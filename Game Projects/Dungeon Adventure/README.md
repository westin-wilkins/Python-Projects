Dungeon Adventure is a text-based adventure game that I'm slowly working on to practice what I've learned after completing CS1301, specifically Object-oriented programming. The game is fully functional; although, I plan on adding more features to it like locked doors needing keys that can be found in rooms by interacting with objects, and also potions to restore health. As of right now, there are only two rooms in the game. One of the rooms is the starting cave to allow the player to try out the different commands. Moving into the second room (Guard Room) by inputting "move north" will intiate combat with an orc.
